  Gatsby with Apollo
</h1>

```
To install and run this, run the following:
gatsby new myapp https://github.com/scottwcode/gatsby-apollo-mystarter.git
cd myapp
yarn add es6-promise isomorphic-fetch
yarn start

```

#A basic example of using Gatsby with Apollo. It uses 2 GraphQL queries: one that gets an image that is statically generated at build time, and another that gets an image that is dynmically generated at run time (and when the image file is changed in the code, it will update the page for the user without a rebuild or even a page refresh).
