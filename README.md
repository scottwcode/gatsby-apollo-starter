  Gatsby with Apollo
</h1>

A basic example of using Gatsby with Apollo. It uses 2 GraphQL queries: one that gets an image that is statically generated at build time, and another that gets an image that is dynmically generated at run time (and when the image file is changed in the code, it will update the page for the user without a rebuild or even a page refresh).
